## Using manual download ZIP

1. Download repository
2. Uncompress to your desired directory

## Install npm dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Setting up environments
1. You will find a file named `.env.example` on root directory of project.
2. Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`

```
cp .env.example .env
```
